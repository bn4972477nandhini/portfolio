              I created a Nanflix website by replicating the Netflix app using
              HTML and CSS. This project focuses on designing the user
              interface, layout, and styling similar to Netflix. Through this
              project, I learned how to structure web pages, use CSS for design,
              and create a responsive layout. It helped me improve my front-end
              development skills.

              Some mothers do not get enough milk for their babies for the first
              two or three months after delivery. At the same time, some mothers
              have more milk than needed. To help solve this problem, I created
              a website where these mothers can connect and support each other
              safely. This website helps share milk responsibly and supports
              babies who need proper nutrition.

              I have created my own student portfolio website to showcase my
              skills and projects. In this portfolio, I included my personal
              details, education, skills, and projects that I built using HTML,
              CSS, and basic JavaScript. I worked on projects like a Nanflix
              website and a mother milk support website, which focus on
              real-life problems. This portfolio helped me present my learning
              journey and improved my confidence as a web developer.
