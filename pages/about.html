<p>
Hello! My name is Nandhini and I am 17 years old. I come from a small village in Thiruvannamalai, where I was raised in a simple and supportive environment that taught me the value of hard work, discipline, and continuous learning. There are five members in my family and  My family background is simple, but they are my biggest source of motivation and strength. Their support encourages me to work hard and achieve my goals in life.

I completed my education from 1st to 12th standard at a Government School, where I built a strong foundation in my studies and developed an interest in learning new things. During my school days, one of my  achievements was successfully completing the SIDP course, which helped me improve my personal development skills and confidence. In 2025, an important turning point in my life came when I joined Freshworks STS Software Academy. After joining the academy, my learning journey completely changed. I was introduced to the world of technology and started learning web development, coding, and modern digital tools, which increased my interest in the IT field.

During my learning journey, I have created two websites from scratch and gained knowledge in web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I also learned Webflow, a low-code and no-code platform used for building websites, and Microsoft Excel to improve my productivity and data management skills. These achievements helped me improve my technical knowledge and boosted my confidence in building real-world projects.

I am still learning new technologies every day and continuously working to improve my skills. My clear goal is to become a successful and professional web developer, contribute to real-world projects, and support my family by building a better future for them. I strongly believe that with dedication, continuous learning, and hard work, I can achieve my dreams and grow both personally and professionally.
