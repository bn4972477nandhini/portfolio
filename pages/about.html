    <p>
      Hello! I'm  <span>Nandhini</span>. I am 17 years old. I am currently living in Chennai, and my native place is Thiruvannamalai. I come from a simple and supportive family background, and my family always motivates me to learn new things and grow in my life.

I completed my 12th standard successfully. After completing my school education, instead of continuing regular higher studies, I decided to develop my skills and gain practical knowledge. So, I completed a SIDP course. Through my mother’s support and guidance, I got the opportunity to join Freshworks STS Software Academy.

Joining the academy was a turning point in my life. My journey changed completely after joining there. I learned many technical skills, especially in web development, and I became capable of creating websites on my own. This helped me improve my confidence and interest in the technology field.

Apart from technical skills, the academy also helped me improve my communication and personal development skills. Through English activities, I improved my spoken English and gained confidence in speaking with others. In life skills sessions, I learned presentation skills, communication skills, and how to collaborate effectively in a team environment.

I also participated in a storytelling competition where I spoke boldly in front of others. That was my first achievement, and it helped me overcome my fear of public speaking. Additionally, in workplace study activities, my squad worked together as a team and won the first prize. This experience taught me the importance of teamwork, leadership, and responsibility.

Overall, my journey helped me grow both personally and professionally. I am continuously learning new skills and working towards building a successful career in the technology field.
